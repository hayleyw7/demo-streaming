# DEMO Streaming

DEMO Streaming provides a list of popular, new movies and series.

[It can be accessed here.](https://auddia-hayley.surge.sh/)

This was created as part an [Auddia Coding Challenge](https://github.com/hayleyw7/auddia-react-coding-challenge).

## Reflections

A challenge was working out stubbing.

Big successes were Router, API calls, data cleaning, and getting stubbing to work.

## Languages and technology

Utilizes JavaScript, React, CSS, HTML/JSX, NPM, Node, Cypress, & Surge

Built with Visual Studio Code

[Code stored on GitHub](https://github.com/hayleyw7/auddia)

## Access and use website

Visit the site [here](https://auddia-hayley.surge.sh/).

When opening the home page, the user will see a header, a footer, and can select between two tiles: "SERIES" and "MOVIES".

Depending on which they choose, they will either be taken to a page for series or movies, where the can alphabetically view the posters and title of 21 releases older than 2013.

## Future additions

* A neat addition would be to allow the user to "favorite" movies.
